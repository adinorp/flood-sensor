*   @defgroup   CBUF Circular Buffer
*   @{
*
*   @brief  A simple and efficient set of circular buffer manipulations.
*
*   These macros implement a circular buffer which employs get and put
*   pointers, in such a way that mutual exclusion is not required
*   (assumes one reader & one writer).
*
*   It requires that the circular buffer size be a power of two, and the
*   size of the buffer needs to smaller than the index. So an 8 bit index
*   supports a circular buffer upto ( 1 << 7 ) = 128 entries, and a 16 bit index
*   supports a circular buffer upto ( 1 << 15 ) = 32768 entries.
*
*   The basis for these routines came from an article in Jack Ganssle's
*   Embedded Muse: http://www.ganssle.com/tem/tem110.pdf
*
*   In order to offer the most amount of flexibility for embedded environments
*   you need to define a macro for the size.
*
*   First, you need to name your circular buffer. For this example, we'll
*   call it @c myQ.
*
*
*   You could then use CBUF_Push to add a character to the circular buffer:
*
*   @code
*   CBUF_Push( myQ, 'x' );
*   @endcode
*
*   And CBUF_Pop to retrieve an element from the buffer:
*
*   @code
*   ch = CBUF_Pop( myQ );
*   @endcode
*
*   If you happen to prefer to use C++ instead, there is a templatized
*   version which requires no macros. You just declare 3 template parameters:
*
*       - The type that should be used for the index
*       - The size of the circular buffer
*       - The type that should be used for the entry
*
*   For example:
*   @code
*   volatile CBUF< uint8_t, 64, char >   myQ;
*   @endcode
